                    Hello! I am Ziqi Cai, a passionate graphic designer and illustrator from China and currently based in Maryland. With a keen eye for detail and a love for telling stories in visual formats, I enjoy transforming ideas into visually elegant and impactful designs. My passion for design is sparked by my strong interest in aesthetics, creativity, and craftsmanship. My work reflects a sense of cleanliness, a control of balance, and offers a glimpse of my culture.
                    <br><br>
                    With a primary focus on <a style='font-weight: 700'>branding</a> and <a style='font-weight: 700'>illustration</a>, I also specialize in <a style='font-weight: 700'>packaging</a>, <a style='font-weight: 700'>type design</a>, <a style='font-weight: 700'>motion design</a>, and <a style='font-weight: 700'>digital experience</a>. I help personal brands and small businesses find their brand essence and build their identities. Previously, I worked at NetEase Games.
                    <br><br>
                    I enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and swimming. A notable adventure of mine was cycling solo around the Taiwan Island, covering a distance of 1,113 km in 12 days. In addition to outdoor pursuits, I also enjoy reading and doodling in my spare time.
                    <br><br>
                    I am lucky to have been born with “talent” as my family name in Chinese literally means talent. However, I believe that talent is not solely innate; it also comes from unceasing efforts and determined goals. I am committed to continuing my exploration of the fascinating world of art and design, with my passion and dedication to continual improvement.
